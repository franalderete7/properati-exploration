#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to do an Exploratory Data Analysis of properties on sale in the city of Buenos Aires. After completing the project, we'll be able to see how data is distributed and which are the important features we'll be working with in the future. 

### Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* Data Cleaning
* Data Filtering

### Technologies
* Python
* Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Description
The dataset we'll be working with was extracted from Properati. The objective is to take the first steps in the process of data exploration using tools such us Numpy, Pandas and Seaborn in order to get a cleaner and more useful version of the dataset. One major challenge we are facing is that there is a large number of NaN values which should be carefully analysed.
